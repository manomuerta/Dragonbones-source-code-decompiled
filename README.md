DISCLAIMER

I don't have any kind of conection with Egret (the companny behind dragon bones) or any person asociated with the devepment of dragon bones

I just decompiled the program in a excercise of preservation and learning about how an animation software like Dragonbones works internally
--------------------------------------------------------------------

this is the decompiled code from Dragonbones for you to copy or analize it, you must know that the code is obfuscated and right now i'm 
working on de-obfuscate the code but is a hard work and is going to take a lot of time so any any contribution welcome (is not like is
gonna happen but it's worth dreaming they say)
